## What is this?

'Niffler' is based on the idea of other tools like 'fzf' and 'grep'. It is a tool
capable of sweeping through a collection of files and summarize their contents on
a searchable 'Inverted Index'.

> **Warning**: 'Niffler' currently supports only *.txt files!

## How to use it?

> **Note**: 'Niffler' is a CLI tool built on a GNU/Linux based system. Support for
> other operating systems is under testing.

#### Requirements:
- python >= 3.9

1. Clone/Download the project repository onto your local machine.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gersonfaneto/Niffler

bash like script.

```bash
